Effects of HIV on the Body
HIV attacks your immune system, making it harder for you to fight off things that can make you sick. As the virus weakens your natural defenses, you might notice signs all over your body. But if you start antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines early in an HIV infection, you won’t have most of these problems.

These drugs can also have some side effects. You'll need to keep an eye out for problems and take steps to prevent or slow them.

HIV Effects on the Immune System
Your immune system has many types of white blood cells that fight infection. HIV gets inside a kind called CD4 cells and makes copies of itself. The virus kills the cell, and the new viruses go off to find more.

Your body responds by making more CD4 cells, but after a while, it can’t keep up with the virus. This makes your immune system weak. You’re more likely to get sick, even from common germs. Infections last longer, are more severe, and might come back more often.

If you follow your doctor’s directions with ART, it knocks out HIV, stopping it from infecting more CD4 cells and from weakening your immune system.
