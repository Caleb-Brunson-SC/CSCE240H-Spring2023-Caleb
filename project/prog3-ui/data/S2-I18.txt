What Is HIV?
HIV is a virus that lives in human blood, sexual fluids, and breast milk. It weakens your immune system, so your body has a hard time fighting off common germs, viruses, fungi, and other invaders. It spreads mainly through unprotected sexual contact and sharing needles.

AIDS -- acquired immune deficiency syndrome -- is the condition that comes when your immune system stops working and you get sick because of HIV.
