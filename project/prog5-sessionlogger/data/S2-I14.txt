Stages of HIV infection

About a month after you get HIV, you might feel like you have the flu. This is the first stage, called primary or acute HIV infection. Symptoms include:

Fever
Skin rash
Sore throat
Fatigue
Swollen lymph nodes

The next stage is called clinical latency, or chronic infection. You might have no symptoms, or only mild ones, for 10 years or more.

Without treatment, as HIV keeps multiplying inside your body, you’ll move into the third stage, which is AIDS. A person who has HIV is diagnosed with AIDS when they have fewer than 200 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter of blood or when they get what’s called an AIDS-defining condition.

AIDS-defining conditions are certain cancers and illnesses called opportunistic infections.

Opportunistic Infections
These infections happen more often or are more severe in people who have weakened immune systems. Some common ones are:

Candidiasis. This is an infection with a fungus called candida that affects your mouth, esophagus, lower respiratory tract, or deep lung tissue.
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). A fungus called Pneumocystis jirovecii infects your lungs and causes cough, fever, and trouble breathing.
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). This bacterial infection can spread through your body, causing fever and weight loss.
Invasive cervical cancer. Cancer starts in your cervix and spreads to other parts of your body.
Cytomegalovirus. This virus can cause problems in your lungs, belly, brain, and eyes.
Kaposi’s sarcoma. Tiny blood vessels grow where they shouldn’t. You might have skin lesions or problems with your lungs, intestines, or lymph nodes.
Lymphoma. This is cancer of your lymph nodes or other tissues of the lymph system.
Tuberculosis. Bacteria cause infection in your lungs and sometimes other parts of your body.
Salmonella septicemia. This is a severe form of salmonella infection in which the bacteria overload your immune system.
