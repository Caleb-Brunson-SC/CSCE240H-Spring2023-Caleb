What can travelers do to prevent HIV?

Talk with your health care provider about PrEP or pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is usually a pill or a shot. PrEP is most effective when it is prescribed by your healthcare provider
Before having sex for the first time with a new partner, you and your partner should talk about your sexual and drug-use history, disclose your HIV status, and get tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.
If you have sex, use condoms the right way every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex, from start to finish.
Do not inject drugs or share needles or other devices that can break the skin. If you do inject drugs, use only new, sterile syringes and needles.
If you get tattoos, piercings, or acupuncture abroad, make sure a new, sterile needle is used each time.
If you get medical or dental care abroad, make sure the equipment is unused or properly sterilized.
If you have HIV and are traveling, your destination may increase your risk of getting opportunistic infections or more severe illnesses from infections like travelersâ€™ diarrhea. Bring enough of your medications to last your entire trip since not all countries have all HIV medication.

Consult your doctor or travel medicine specialist at least 4 weeks before leaving as you may not be eligible for certain travel vaccines required at your destination, or you may need to take additional precautions.
