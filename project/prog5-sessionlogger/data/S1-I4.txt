Who is at risk?

Travelers are generally at low risk for getting HIV unless they engage in activities that could put them at risk, such as having unprotected sex or sharing needles.

A person can get HIV by being stuck with a contaminated needle or another sharp object, though this is more of a risk for healthcare workers. Some low-income countries may not adequately screen their blood supplies or properly sterilize medical equipment used in medical clinics, dental clinics, and hospitals. There is a small chance that travelers to these countries who receive medical care could get infected.

HIV infection affects people globally. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most affected part of the world. Still, other regions significantly affected by HIV include Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia.
