HIV Effects on the Eyes

Some eye problems are mild, but others can be severe enough to cause blindness. Some of the most common are infections that can lead to bleeding in your retina (the tissue at the back of your eye) and retinal detachment. About 7 in 10 people with untreated AIDS will have AIDS-related trouble with their eyes, usually because of cytomegalovirus.

You may not have any symptoms until the problems are far along, so if you have advanced HIV, it's important to get regular eye exams. Call your doctor if your vision changes, including if:

You get blurry or double vision.
Colors don't look right.
You see spots.
You have watery or red eyes.
You're sensitive to light.
Your eyes hurt.
