	What Is HIV Testing?
HIV testing, also called HIV screening, is the only way to know if you have the virus.

	Several types of tests check your blood or other body fluids to see whether you're infected. Most can't spot HIV right away because it takes time for your body to make antibodies or for enough of the virus to grow inside you.

	Importance of HIV Testing
If you have the virus, finding out quickly means you can start treatment right away so you can feel better and live a long, full life. You can also take steps so you don't pass HIV to other people.

How Do HIV Tests Work?
There are two basic ways to get HIV test results:

	Laboratory tests. For these tests, a technician takes a sample of your blood and tests it. You’ll get results within a few days.

	Rapid tests. These tests provide results in about 20-30 minutes. You can get them done in a community clinic or take them at home.

	When to Get Tested
If you’ve had a high-risk exposure to HIV very recently, go to the emergency room or call your doctor right away. Examples include unsafe sex with someone who has HIV or if you were sexually assaulted. Emergency drugs c
