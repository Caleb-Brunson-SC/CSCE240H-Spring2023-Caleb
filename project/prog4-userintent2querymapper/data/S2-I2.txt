Effects of Antiretroviral Drugs on the Body
Antiretroviral therapy helps people who have HIV live longer, healthier lives and lowers their risk of spreading the virus. The drugs can have side effects, many of which go away with time. Overall, the benefits outweigh the risks.

There are several kinds of antiretroviral drugs, and your doctor might combine them in different ways. Side effects can vary from drug to drug or from person to person.

Common side effects of these drugs include:

Upset stomach and vomiting
Diarrhea
Trouble sleeping
Headache
Rash
Dizziness
Fatigue
Talk to your doctor if you have any of these problems. They might be able to change your medication or give you something else to deal with the effects.

Make your health a priority. Take your medications as directed, and let your doctor know about any changes or new symptoms.
