Hello!

The input.txt file must contain exactly 9 words in the correct format.

The program will first ask you for the file path to your input.txt file.
Then, the program will ask you for the file path to your output.txt file.

Finally, the program will ask you to enter 1 to calculate AREA or to enter 2 to calculate PERIMETER.

The output of the calculation will be inserted into your output.txt file.

Example of inputs and outputs for the program can be found in the "example 1" and "example 2" directories.
The "example 1" directory contains an output from running the PERIMETER calculation.
The "example 2" directory contains an output from running the AREA calculation.
